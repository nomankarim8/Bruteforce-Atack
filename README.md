# Subextractor

**Subextractor** is a Python script designed to extract and decode hidden base64 encoded messages within the code. This tool can be particularly useful for analyzing obfuscated code and extracting hidden data.

## Features

- Decodes base64 encoded strings within the provided code.
- Identifies and reveals hidden or obfuscated messages.
- Simple and easy to use.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nomankarim8/subextractor.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd subextractor
```

## Usage

To use the Subextractor script, simply run it in your terminal. The script is self-contained and doesn't require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library.

```python
python subextractor.py
```

You can replace the `subextractor` variable in the script with your code that contains the hidden base64 encoded message. The script will automatically decode and display the hidden message.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use the script:

```python
import base64

subextractor = """<your_base64_encoded_string_here>"""
```

After running the script, the decoded message will be displayed in the terminal.
