Here is a possible README.md file for the Facebook BruteForce script:

**Facebook BruteForce**
=====================

A Facebook BruteForce tool written in Python, using the mechanize library.

**Features**
------------

* Brute-forces Facebook passwords using a provided wordlist
* Supports multiple types of wordlists (e.g. pk.txt)
* Writes the login attempt to a file named "Facebook-Log.txt"
* Displays a message if the password is found or not

**Usage**
--------

1. Install the mechanize library by running `pip install mechanize` in your terminal.
2. Run the script using `python2` (due to the mechanize library's compatibility issues with Python 3).
3. Enter the target username/ID/email when prompted.
4. Enter the path to your wordlist file when prompted.
5. The script will start brute-forcing passwords and display the results.

**Note**
-----

* **Do not use this script for malicious purposes.** Facebook's terms of service prohibit automated login attempts, and this script can potentially get you banned from using their services.
* **The script does not guarantee that it will find the correct password.** It is still a brute-forcing tool, and the likelihood of finding the correct password depends on the strength of the password and the quality of the wordlist.
* **The script is provided as-is, without warranty or support.** Use it at your own risk.
