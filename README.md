# Facebook BruteForce Tool

### **Disclaimer:** 
This tool is created solely for educational and ethical hacking purposes. The developer is not responsible for any illegal or unauthorized use of this tool. Please use responsibly.

## Description

The Facebook BruteForce Tool is designed to demonstrate how a brute force attack can be attempted on Facebook login credentials. **Note**: Unauthorized access to someone's Facebook account is illegal and against Facebook's terms of service. Always ensure you have explicit permission from the account owner before attempting any penetration testing.

This script attempts to log in to a Facebook account using a list of potential passwords provided in a wordlist file. It uses the `mechanize` library to automate the login process.

## Features

- Automates the login process on Facebook using a username/ID/email and a list of passwords.
- Demonstrates how brute force attacks can be executed.
- Python 3 compatible.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `mechanize` library (Install with `pip install mechanize`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nomankarim8/facebook-bruteforce.git
   cd facebook-bruteforce
   ```

2. **Install the required Python package:**

   ```bash
   pip install mechanize
   ```

3. **Prepare your wordlist file:**

   Ensure you have a wordlist file (e.g., `pk.txt`) in the same directory. The file should contain potential passwords, each on a new line.

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python3 facebook_bruteforce.py
   ```

2. **Provide the target username/ID/email and the wordlist file when prompted:**

   ```
   [ðŸ’€] Target Username/ID/Email >> target@example.com
   [ðŸ’€] Wordlist Type pk.txt >>
   ```

3. The script will start attempting to log in using each password from the wordlist.

## Example

```bash
[ðŸ’€] Target Username/ID/Email >> john.doe@example.com
[ðŸ’€] Wordlist Type pk.txt >> passwords.txt

Cracking john.doe@example.com Now...
